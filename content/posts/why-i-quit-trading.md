title: Why Did I Quit?

The summer after I graduated from college, I found my desk within the row of equity derivatives traders, in the building that Lehman Brothers once proudly called their global headquarters. I was here to learn the art of risk taking and price making, to fulfill a lifelong interest in finance by working at the beating heart of markets. Little more than 6 months later, I would quit with the difficult realization that though I enjoyed trading and outwitting the competition in the grand game of financial markets, I couldn't do it as a full-time career. I told myself that I was being weak, idealistic, a flighty millennial, but nothing could overturn the conviction that my twenties were my chance to find a career with a mission that mattered to me.

It all started rather promisingly. I joined the biotech team, which consisted of two traders and an analyst. Biotech and its idiosyncratic catalysts meant that there was still enormous alpha for human traders to find, and the biotech team was living proof that the efficient market hypothesis was flawed.

The Friday afternoon of my second week, my desk analyst mentioned an upcoming FDA Advisory Committee. After a weekend of being the only person on the cavernous trading floor, digging through briefing materials, I argued that the FDA was going to withdraw the drug. My head trader said good work, swung back to his Bloomberg terminal, and to my surprise started repositioning the book. The next day I stared at a group of old and distinguished scientists debating whether the treatment effect for a particular subgroup was sufficient like they were missionaries delivering the gospel, because as the stock convulsed after their decision, my team made more money than my annual salary. Far more.

It was solid win. I had proven that I had the drive and the guts to take calculated risks. The research was interesting and the impact was immediate. But curiosity and a willingness to work hard wasn't enough.

Trading is not investment banking. Traders are not expected to leave after two years to business school or private equity. If senior traders left, it was to a hedge fund or prop trading firm, which basically meant doing the same thing but with less regulatory oversight. 

In spite of having done my research on the limited exit opportunities for trading, I still accepted the job. I told myself I already put in years of effort to pursue this interest and I couldn't give up this opportunity. I told myself that it's easier to move from finance to tech than from tech to finance. I told myself that so many other people would kill to be in my position. I told myself at worst, you could prove you could handle a fast-paced, entrepreneurial environment where your merit was ruthlessly marked to market.

What I didn't know was that my job would essentially be an apprenticeship. I was expected to shadow my trader and learn through osmosis for at least two years. I had projects and daily tasks like booking trades. But above all, I was to follow along and try to figure out what was going on in my trader's head without being an annoyance.

The good part about this kind of apprenticeship model is that you get to intimately experience what the job is like at the highest level. The hard part about is that you're a rookie thrown into the ocean of markets, and you're expected to do whatever it takes to catch up and swim with the sharks. This model can work great, because you're given the freedom to explore, but it also means you have to really want the job. 

And I didn't want the job. Even though I watched senior traders, who made millions, leave a few minutes after market close at 4:00PM to pick up their kids. Even though my coworkers were brilliant, hard-working, and helpful. Even though I was being paid six figures, lived in Manhattan, and didn't have to work weekends like my roommates in banking. 

It all didn't matter because I was young, debt free, and couldn't shake the feeling that my twenties were my chance at a career that meant more than a way to make a living. After a few draining months, which I told myself was just a period of readjustment, it became apparent that I didn't love trading like my coworkers did, didn't get the same fulfillment they had beating the market and proving your worth in what is arguably the most competitive game in the world.

I like money. But it didn't fill the hollowness as I emptied myself to work hard for a career I didn't want. I shared my concerns with my manager. I explored other roles at the company. Research. Risk. Quant Trading. But it was the same company, the same people, the same mission, that I didn't want, no matter how hard I tried to convince myself that I should.

I was experiencing the worst burnout in my life when I called my parents, told them I tried, but I couldn't, they said it's ok, you can come home, so I showed up the next day to the office and told my managers thank you, I've given the other internal opportunities some thought, but I'm leaving. As I handed in my keycard I knew I was stepping off the track and out into the unknown. Before that moment I was proud of always having an internship or job lined up, of steadily ascending the stairway of success. I had so much of what I wanted – independence, money, a promising career – but over a few days, I gave it all up.

For months afterward, I couldn't help but think I was just another spoiled kid who decided to take a year off to "discover himself." But my self pity and self loathing wasn't getting me anywhere. I decided to live, as Christopher Hitchens said, "as if", as if everything that happened, all the mistakes I've made, is something I can look back at with gratitude.

So what if burning out, quitting my job, and restarting my career, was a gift?

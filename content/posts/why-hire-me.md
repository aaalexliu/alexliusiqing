title: Why Hire Me as a Coder

> The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination... Not all is delight, however.... Human beings are not accustomed to being perfect, and few areas of human activity demand it. Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program.

If I’ve learned anything from recruiting, it’s that when someone asks why this job, what they really want to know why should we hire you for this job. So here's the 30-second hard sell:

I want to build the future and be financially independent. [Trading didn't fit, so I burned out and ultimately quit.](./why-i-quit-trading) As a CS major in a world being eaten by software, I decided the best way to prove my worth is as a software engineer. I didn't feel useful at first, but signing up for an AWS account showed me I could build something better and cheaper, something that people would pay for, and gave me the confidence to tackle modern tech like Terraform, GraphQL, Docker, and Typescript. Through building my app full-time, I proved that I had the passion to ride the highs and lows of producing working code. Combined with my experience working in finance, where the team comes first and high expectations are the norm, I have the potential to be the right fit for your team.

## God Doesn't Beat AWS at Customer Obsession

As I started choosing which skills to invest my time in, I asked myself a simple question: is this the future? Or to put it more concretely, would this technology make my product better or cheaper enough to get someone to pay for it?

It's a question that haunted me at first. A few months after I quit my job, I had picked up enough full-stack development to build a basic CRUD app, the millionth twitter clone. But I still had lingering depression and burn out, a gnawing fear of being useless, and as I stared at my app it felt like a 6-year old's crayon drawing attached to the fridge – cute, but ultimately only you and maybe your parents cared. 

Some people recover from depression by finding God. When I opened an AWS Developer account and witnessed its awesome power, I found God's equivalent for aspiring full-stack engineers, for even the Almighty doesn't beat AWS at Customer Obsession. Reading AWS Customer Case Studies felt like being granted divine prophecy, because they had a dirt cheap, scalable solution for all the "undifferentiated heavy lifting" I  struggled with, endorsed by engineering teams that had billions of devoted users. AWS was the future, and it had a Free Tier.

The confidence I found figuring out Lambda, Cognito, CloudFormation — the list of perplexing AWS product names goes on — launched me into GraphQL, Docker, Terraform, and Typescript. Backend features took hours instead of days. What I was aiming for – a clone of a web app built by an ex-Stripe engineer, but better and cheaper– became code deployed to my humble village in the cloud. Yet I knew the village could scale instantly, on-demand, and the cost would be billed down to the penny. I would need to put in a lot more work, add features, and figure out SEO and Producthunt, but if I got this far, I knew I had what it takes to make something people will pay for.

## Debugging: Tremendous Joy from Small Success

If burning out from my job was a gift, it taught me that making money wasn't enough. So now that I was freshly unemployed, with no one telling me what to do, it was time to test if I had the personality to spend all night on a bug and wake up the next day eager to build.

Coding can be delightful, beautiful, a mode of pure creative problem-solving, everything the zeitgeist idolizes as 'flow'. What drew me to finance – the rigorous, logical thinking, the constant opportunities to learn and satisfy my curiosity – also drew me to programming.

But I knew that if I was going to code full-time, I had to be able to get through every single WTF moment to design, write, and deploy a complete product. As Clive Thompson quotes in *Coders:* “The programmer personality is someone who has the ability to derive a tremendous sense of joy from an incredibly small moment of success.” 

The surest sign I was passing the personality test, that I would willingly work with something that was never wrong, was each time my Youtube ads switched, from Prisma to AWS to Hashicorp to Figma to CircleCI. Otherwise, the days blurred together, as I opened VSCode to a lottery of problems. Sometimes, a saint on Stackoverflow had the exact solution. Sometimes, after hours or days of cruel, grinding, unyielding failure, I find a fix, and that king-of-the-world dopamine surge hits. For me, that determined satisfaction was enough to get me through to the next feature, the next bug, and to a fully functional product.

## Teamwork, Or Passing the Airport Test

Meeting the inhuman demands of a computer can be a source of pride, tangible proof of ones skills. But I willingly went to a liberal arts college and got a History major, a discipline that explicitly refuses to reduce the dignified mess of the human condition down into a formula.

Some coders may forget that humans sell products, but if there's one trait that finance screens for above all, it's the ability to work in teams. Bankers have a corporate upgrade to the folksy question 'Would I grab a beer with this kid', the Airport Test: 'Would I want to be stuck with this kid if my flight was delayed,' and I was one of the lucky summer analysts that passed. But when I hit the desk my job was also to work with Sales, Research, IT, Risk, Trade Capture Utility, and more – as the junior, I was stuck with all the problems my desk didn't want to solve. Likability and teamwork are best endorsed by someone other than the person himself, so I'm happy to provide my manager's contact information as reference.

## I Can Write

If your team is looking for someone that has both the technical capability to build a modern, scalable, full-stack MVP and the experience working in a demanding, high pressure, and tight-knit environment like finance, I could be the right fit.

If, dear reader, I still have your attention, it also means I can write, and though my history professors may be aghast at such an artlessly corporate conclusion, they were paid to read my essays, so thank you for your time.

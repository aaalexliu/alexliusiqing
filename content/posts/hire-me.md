I graduated from Amherst College in 2019 as a double major in CS and History, went to work at Barclays as an Equity Derivatives Trader, and left to become a software engineer ([why I quit](/why-i-quit-trading)). Since then I've built a modern, scalable web app end-to-end ([www.margins.me](https://www.margins.me)), and I also helped a start-up [build an IoT analytics stack.](/portfolio/iot-analytics)

I can do Full Stack / Generalist and I'm also open to Front End or Back End roles.

I have US citizenship, am currently in Shanghai, and I'm ready to relocate once I find some vaccine.

I had experience with Python and R from college, but I wanted to prove I could build a modern application, so I learned the basics of PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node.js. I wasn't satisfied. So I opened an AWS account, and learned Terraform, Docker, GraphQL and TypeScript. I ended up using AWS Cognito, Lambda, SES, SAM, EC2, RDS, and plenty of other keywords to build [Margins](https://www.margins.me), an app that is heavily inspired by [readwise.io](https://readwise.io/).

[This write-up](/portfolio/margins/overview/) has links to the full source code, an overview of the architecture, and discussion of design decisions. I detail tradeoffs such as Apollo vs. Relay, why not Redux (yet), Gatsby vs. Next.js, programmatically generating a GraphQL server, relational vs. non-relational, special PostgreSQL features, why Serverless, and Serverless deployment tools. You will also find a Terraform dependency graph, a Security Header Grade, a schema visualization, and Lighthouse Scores.

As for Python, my first exposure was the Anaconda ecosystem during college, where I won 3rd prize in Portfolio Investing at the UChicago Midwest Trading Competition, and I've refreshed my Python working through Elements of Programming Interviews. My R experience is mostly from almost finishing the statistics major – [this was my capstone project.](/portfolio/college/yelp-challenge)

**I could be a fit for your team if you’re looking for the following:**

- **Work to me is more than money or prestige.** After years of pursuing my lifelong interest in finance, I gave up my six figure Wall Street job because I couldn't dedicate my twenties to making markets. I went through this career reset to work for a mission that matters to me.
- **Grit.** I’ve never run a marathon but I can deadlift 400 pounds.
- **Resourceful and willing to learn**. I went to a liberal arts college where web development courses at a partner university couldn’t count towards the CS major because it was too "applied". I picked up the knowledge I needed to build from pdfs, online tutorials, Github Issues, developer blog posts, and documentation. I figured out the latest version of a framework even though their developer facing guide is [broken](https://github.com/apollographql/fullstack-tutorial/issues/161).
- **Risk-taker and self-starter.** I was a fresh analyst on the biotech trading desk ready to prove his worth. On a Friday afternoon my desk analyst mentioned that the briefing materials for an upcoming FDA Advisory Committee meeting had been released and it'd be a good learning experience. After a weekend alone on the cavernous trading floor, I took it a step further and argued that the market was mispricing the chance that the committee would recommend withdrawing the drug. Our team made more money than my annual salary.
- **Whatever it takes to help the team.** I’ve written and debugged Excel macros to support legacy systems that have been running since the early 2000s. I've spent weeks pinging IT with emails, phone calls, and in-person visits until I got the necessary approvals to get software that would help my team.
- **Success in fast-paced, tight-knit environments.** A Sales and Trading summer internship is essentially an 3 month test to see if you can handle the hustle of a trading floor. I was given a return offer to one of the most important markets franchises at Barclays.
- **Polish matters.** Even though it wasn't technically necessary for my app's front end, I've vertically centered divs, tweaked padding, and picked up enough CSS to clean up janky UI.
- **Writer and Storyteller:** I majored in History and willingly chose classes where I wrote [20+ page research papers](/portfolio/college/therapeutic-transformations). I've written [investment two-pagers and made pitch decks](/portfolio/finance/bic). I've given [presentations on technical topics](/portfolio/college/econ-470).

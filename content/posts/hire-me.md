I graduated from Amherst College as a double major in CS and History, went to work at Barclays as a Flow Volatility Trader, and quit after 6 months ([why I quit](http://alexliusiqing.com/why-i-quit-trading)). Since then I've built a modern, scalable web app end-to-end ([www.margins.me](https://www.margins.me)), and I also helped a start-up [build an IoT analytics stack.](https://alexliusiqing.com/portfolio/iot-analytics)

I'm looking for a team focused on an early-stage or high-growth product. I can do Full Stack, but I'm also open to Front End or Back End roles.

I have US citizenship, am currently in Shanghai, and I'm ready to relocate once I find some vaccine.

After getting off the finance career track, I started re-skilling by learning PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js, and Heroku. I realized that this was not enough to build better, faster, or cheaper. So I threw away my old code, opened an AWS account, and learned Terraform, Docker, GraphQL and TypeScript. I ended up using AWS Cognito, Lambda, SES, SAM, EC2, RDS, and plenty of other resume keywords to build [Margins](https://www.margins.me), an app that is heavily inspired by [readwise.io](http://readwise.io).

All the code is public on Github. Along with Github links, I've written a full overview of the architecture and design decisions [here](https://alexliusiqing.com/portfolio/margins/overview/). I discuss tradeoffs such as Apollo vs. Relay, why not Redux (yet), Gatsby vs. Next.js, programmatically generating a GraphQL server, relational vs. non-relational, PostgreSQL features, why Serverless, and Serverless deployment tools. You will also find a Terraform dependency graph, Security Header Grade, schema visualization, and Lighthouse Scores.

I also have experience with Python and R. I finished the 1 month track of Elements of Programming Interviews in Python after mainly using the Anaconda ecosystem during college. My R experience is mostly from almost finishing the statistics major – [this was my capstone project.](https://alexliusiqing.com/portfolio/college/yelp-challenge)

**I could be a cultural fit for your team if you’re looking for the following:**


- **Work to me is more than money or prestige.** After years of pursuing my lifelong interest in finance, I gave up my six figure Wall Street job and committed to a career hard reset because I couldn't dedicate my twenties to making markets. I want a career that can also be my mission.
- **Grit:** I’ve never run a marathon but I can deadlift 400 pounds.
- **Resourceful and willing to learn**. I went a liberal arts college where web development courses at a partner university couldn’t count towards the CS major because it was too "applied". Everything I've learned came from an assortment of pdfs, online tutorials, Github Issues, and developer blog posts. I've picked up the latest versions of a framework even though their developer facing guide is [broken](https://github.com/apollographql/fullstack-tutorial/issues/161).
- **Risk-taker and self-starter.** I was a fresh analyst on the biotech trading desk ready to prove his worth. On a Friday afternoon my desk analyst mentioned that the briefing materials for an upcoming FDA Advisory Committee meeting had been released and it'd be a good learning experience. After a weekend alone on the cavernous trading floor I took it a step further and argued that the market was mispricing the chance that the committee would recommend withdrawing the drug. Our team made more money than my annual salary.
- **Whatever it takes to help the team.** I’ve written and debugged Excel macros to support legacy systems that have been running since the early 2000s. I've spent weeks pinging IT with emails, phone calls, and in-person visits until I got the necessary approvals to get the software that would help my team.
- **Success in fast-paced, tight-knit environments.** A Sales and Trading summer internship is essentially an 3 month interview to see if you can handle the hustle of a trading floor. I was given a return offer to one of the most important markets franchises at Barclays.
- **Polish matters.** Even though it wasn't technically necessary for my app's front end, I've vertically centered divs, tweaked padding, and picked up enough CSS to get rid of any janky UI.
- **Writer and Story Teller:** I voluntarily majored in History and wrote [20+ page research papers](https://alexliusiqing.com/portfolio/college/therapeutic-transformations). I've written [investment two-pagers and made pitch decks.](https://alexliusiqing.com/portfolio/finance/bic) I've given [presentations on technical topics](https://alexliusiqing.com/portfolio/college/econ-470).
